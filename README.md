# Object-Tracking-using-YOLO

## Object Tracking
Object tracking involves locating and following objects as they move within a sequence of frames in a video or a set of images. The goal is to maintain the identity of the objects over time, which is crucial for applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality.

## YOLO Network
YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is a popular object detection algorithm that excels in real-time object detection tasks. YOLO divides an image into a grid and performs object detection in a single pass through the neural network. This is in contrast to traditional methods that involve multiple passes, making YOLO faster and more efficient.
